# src Folder

This folder has subfolders 'php' and 'shell'.

The PHP programs are used to process source lists and ultimately to create banned_whole_usernames.txt.

I run ParseTuralus.php to break down the CSV into multiple language files. Then I run Aggregator.php to pull that data and other lists into the final banned_whole_usernames.txt file.

I copy that file to my own personalized file, banned_whole_usernames_tg.txt, which is then modified for my own purposes.

I welcome you to compare the _tg verson to the base to see changes that I prefer, but create your own _initials.txt file that has your own preferences.
